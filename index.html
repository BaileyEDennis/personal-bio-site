    <p>Originally Majoring in Classical Music Performance at MTSU, Bailey has always had a passion for technology. Since childhood Bailey has built her own PC's, Learned the Linux(tm) operating system, and pursued classes in coding while in High School and 
        University. Since graduating MTSU (B.S. Integrated Studies) and breifly working as a tech support agent for Verizon, she decided to continue her education through Nashville Software School to get her into the web development side of the tech industry. What originally began
        as a hobby and interest in childhood has been a driving force in her life and a consistent theme. Bailey enjoys the puzzle solving challenges programming brings with it, and enjoys styling web pages to look aestetic. She especially follows a design philosophy
        as originally thought out by designer Dieter Rams, who has also had influence on Mid Century Modern architecture, Modern product designs, and especially Apple Computers, inc.</p>
